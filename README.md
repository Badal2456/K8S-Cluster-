# ALL ABOUT PODS

**PODS** ---

What are Pods?

1.Pods are the smallest and most basic deployable objects in Kubernetes.

2.Think of a Pod as a single instance of a containerized application.

3.Each Pod consists of one or more containers that share resources, such as storage and networking, and are scheduled together on the same node.


**Why Pods?**

1.Pods provide a way to encapsulate an application's container(s) along with shared resources.

2.They enable applications to be easily deployed, scaled, and managed in a Kubernetes cluster.


**How are Pods Created?**

1.Pods are typically defined using YAML configuration files.

2.The YAML file specifies details about the Pod, such as the container image, ports, environment variables, and resource requirements.

**Example YAML Configuration for a Pod--** 

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Backend Story:**

1.When you apply this YAML configuration to the Kubernetes cluster (kubectl apply -f pod.yaml), Kubernetes reads the configuration and schedules the Pod to run on a suitable node in the cluster.

2.The Kubernetes scheduler selects an appropriate node based on available resources and any constraints specified in the Pod's configuration.
Once scheduled, the container(s) within the Pod are created and run on the node.

3.Kubernetes continuously monitors the Pod's health and automatically restarts the container(s) if they fail or terminate unexpectedly.
You can interact with and manage the Pod using kubectl commands, such as kubectl get pods, kubectl describe pod, and kubectl delete pod.

**Conclusion:**

1.Pods are the **fundamental building blocks** of applications in Kubernetes.

2.They encapsulate one or more containers and provide a consistent environment for running and managing applications.
By defining Pods with YAML configuration files, you can easily deploy and manage applications in Kubernetes clusters.
